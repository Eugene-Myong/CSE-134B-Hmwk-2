<!--Editors Note: Lots of content is unfinished, some images I need are not in my
currrent possession (some are on a hard drive back home) and text descriptions are not
finalized either (since the length affects the layout and image formatting etc) 
I tried to implement examples of at least the professional page since that one probably matters
the most, but I will add proper text and images as we go along
At least I hope that's ok I saw on slack that we can use placeholder text and images
